# 🔖 About
Solana File Sharing System is a Decentralized Application that helps users share files anonymously and ensure that the files are available at all times on a decentralized network, not tampered with, verifiable, and secure for all parties involved. Our goal is to help people share important information to the public in a way that is accessible and gives the power to back to users. Anyone in the world can access information that is uploaded - a decentralized system that will give a voice to everyone who needs it, be it activists, media personnel, everyday people, companies, etc. Data can neither be blocked nor corrupted - this is decentralization.

### Our Mission
Our mission is to truly harness the power of blockchain and the distributed web to ensure important data can be easily uploaded and accessed by anyone in the world. A decentralized, secure, verified, and anonymous file sharing system based on the foundations of blockchain technology.

### How it Works
Solana File Sharing System primarily relies on IPFS and Solana. The InterPlanetary File System is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. IPFS uses content-addressing to uniquely identify each file in a global namespace connecting all computing devices. What this means is that as long as the file is available on the network, it will be available to anyone in the world. Content can be shared securely, timestamped, and verified at all times will ensuring permanent distribution and availability. Users can link their Solana wallets and access all files uploaded on the site (supported by IPFS) and can also upload files on the network.
